关于HiC数据质控的说法
Qualitycontrol/troubleshoot.Notethatthemajorityofstatisticsdevelopedas part of the Juicer pipeline are not robust with respect to the draft genome assembly quality and will differ dramatically when the same Hi-C library is processed against genome assemblies of varying levels of contiguity. As such they can have limited utility for quality control and troubleshooting, especially for highly fragmented genomes.
In such cases it is often useful to pay attention to the percentage of reads containing ligation junctions in the raw fastq files of the Hi-C library. The exact number depends on the restriction enzyme, size selection protocols and the sequencing read length, but typically amounts to 20-40% for a reasonably good in situ Hi-C library. Low numbers may indicate poor Hi-C data quality.
